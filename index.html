            <p>full-stack developer is a developer or engineer who can build both the front end and the back end of a website. The front end (the parts of a website a user sees and interacts with) and the back end (the behind-the-scenes data storage and processing) require different skill sets. Since full-stack developers are involved with all aspects of the development process, they must have expertise in both.</p>

            <p></p> corporate world can be very daunting or very demanding, especially when you are a fresher. From a comparatively plain sailing journey of a college university life to a highly competitive working environment, the transition is never easy. Yet I can tell you that getting into the battleground is damn exciting. You get to learn technologies that you might have never heard of, learn stuff from the elites out there and the best of all; you feel important because your code and your effort matters to the company.</p>
